Source 1:
Name:Haskell Language Documentation (Prelude)  
URL: https://www.haskell.org/documentation/  
Used and function explanation:
Used as a reference for basic Haskell syntax, recursion patterns, pattern matching,
and type signatures. This source helped clarify how functions such as `(++)`, guards, and recursive definitions behave in Haskell. No code was copied directly.


Source 2:
Name: GHC User’s Guide / GHCi Documentation  
URL: https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html users_guide/  
Used and function explanation:
Used to understand how to run `stack ghci`, interpret type errors, and use commands such as `:t` to inspect types. This source was not used to implement any assignment
functions directly.


Source 3:
Name: Wikipedia – Luhn Algorithm  
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm  

Used and function explanation:
Used to understand the high-level steps of the Luhn algorithm for validating creditcard numbers. This included the conceptual process of 
reversing digits, doubling every other digit, summing digits greater than 9, and checking divisibility by 10.
The Haskell implementation was written independently to conform to assignment restrictions.


Source 4:
Name: Course Materials – CSE 114A Lecture Notes and Assignment Handout  
URL: https://canvas.ucsc.edu  
Used and function explanation:
Used for understanding assignment requirements, function behavior expectations, and constraints (e.g., only using `(++)` and `(==)` for list operations). Examples and function descriptions guided the structure of the implementations.
